If you're concerned about the middle 95%, then 2.5% of the values are below them and 2.5% of all the values are above them. The rainfall values at those edges are what you use for the ranges to quote. \n",

    "*Hint!* This part becomes much easier if you sort all the values using any of the numpy/Python sort functions you can read about online. When you sort them, you should be able to find what rainfall is at the edge for the lower 2.5% and the higher 2.5%. "
